## What I bring to the table

I have a career as a professional software developer which spans over 20 years. I have spent a lot of this time working as Team Lead on small teams or as the sole developer building new applications from the ground up in industries such as Finance, Insurance, Human Resouces, Warehousing and more. 

I can take software projects **from conception to final delivery**. At all times I am **honest with clients about my abilities**, and my 20+ years of experience allow me to make decisions which are in the **best interest of the project**.

I have over three years experience in working either as a remote employee, or remotely as a freelancer which allows me to **work independently**, yet ensure that status of the project and related tasks are **communicated clearly** to all stakeholders at all times.

I am comfortable working across the **entire stack** for web applications, and I am also familiar with other types of applications, such as command-line and serverless applications.

I have a lot of experience working with **authentication and authorization** (specifically technologies such as OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT), as I have been responsible for the development and maintenance of all the .NET SDKs, sample applications and tutorials for [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) over the past 2+ years. I have also been involved in various other open source projects related to OAuth 2.0.

I blog on this website about .NET related topics and also curate [ASP.NET Weekly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/aspnetweekly/), which is a weekly digest of all the best ASP.NET related news and blog posts. This newsletter curation process gives me a great high-level awareness of the current state-of-the-art in software development, as well as the tools and technologies that are available to support the software development life cycle.

I am also the primary contributor and maintainer of [various open source utilities](/tools). Beside coding, running an Open Source project requires skills such as **product management, project management and customer support**.

## Work I am interested in

I am interested in freelance work requiring C#, .NET Core or ASP.NET Core skills - either as part of an existing team or working solo on a stand-alone project or proof-of-concept.

## Technologies I work with

The following are some of the primary technologies I am familiar with and have recent experience with:

* ASP.NET Core (MVC, Razor Pages and APIs)
* HTML, JavaScript and CSS
* Angular
* OpenID Connect
* JSON Web Tokens
* Serverless (AWS Lambda and Azure Functions)
* Auth0
* Command-line applications
