## Introduction

I currently work for a company which is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. I, along with the rest of the software development team is however located in Bangkok, Thailand. I have found myself a few times trying to figure out the time in the Sydney office, so a colleague showed me how you could set up multiple clocks in Windows 10.

## Adding additional clocks

Right-click on the date/time display in the Windows taskbar, and select the _Adjust date/time_ item from the context menu:

Next, select the _Add clocks for different time zones_ option:

![Select the add clocks option](/images/blog/2018-10-26-clocks-for-multiple-timezones-windows10/select-add-clocks.png)

This will open the _Date and Time_ dialog to the _Additional Clocks_ tab. Enable the clock for the extra time zone you want to track and click the _OK_ button when done.

This will not add the extra clock to the taskbar, but when you hover over the date/time display in the taskbar, you will see a tooltip containing the additional clocks you added:

Also, when you click on the date/time display in the taskbar to open the calendar flyout, you will see the additional clocks listed:

Unfortunately, this does not allow you to add more than two additional clocks, but for someone who only wants to keep track of one or two extra time zones, this is a good solution.
